  youtube_description: 'This episode features a wide-ranging conversation about poetry:
    what it is, where it comes from, and why it matters. Our guest, poet (and poetry
    professor) Joshua Bennett, talks about the early experiences that pushed him toward
    poetry and about the people who shaped and inspired his creative approach as a
    writer. Many of these people are fellow poets, others are his own grandparents,
    parents, and teachers, but Prof. Bennett has also found inspiration in less expected
    figures; over the course of the interview, he name-checks the singers Yolanda
    Adams and Marvin Gaye, the biologists Charles Henry Turner and Ernest Everett
    Just, the astronaut Mae Jemison, and various characters from the TV series Star
    Trek: the Next Generation. Other topics Prof. Bennett addresses include the relation
    between poetry and generative AI (his own work is among the vast body of text
    that has been fed as training data into large language models), education as liberation,
    and the concept of social poetics. Eventually, the interview blossoms into a heartfelt
    meditation on human experience: childhood, aging, parenthood, identity, and the
    ways poetry enhances our humanity by capturing the magic of being alive.'
